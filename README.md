# Bank-Management-System-using-JAVA

This Bank Management System Application is not exactly the Bank system like KIOSK.

This Bank Management System is created using JAVA, Jsp, MYSQL database.

I have used Eclipse but you can any IDE which suits your style of coding.

Use XAMPP Server or WAMP for PHPMyAdmin.

Import mysql-connector-java-5.1.23-bin.jar and jcalendar-tz-1.3.3-4.jar in Eclipse IDE.


DATABASE:
1. To set this application, make sure PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the bms.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. Upload all files on your server except for bms.sql.
4. The login details you can create your own.
